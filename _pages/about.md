Hi, I am a PhD student in the [Intelligent Interactive Systems](https://www-edc.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/intelligent-interactive-systems) group at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Per Ola Kristensson](https://pokristensson.com/). My research focuses on human-AI interaction theory and text entry systems. Specifically, I am interested in human-AI cooperation and AI for accessibility. 

Prior to my PhD, I had my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Manchester and my master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from UCL.

Many studies about accessibility are abandoned due to various reasons, while individuals with accessibility needs are eager to enhance their quality of life. Inspired by [IDEO Bendable project](https://www.ideo.com/works/bendable), we are in the process of establishing a non-profit organization (NPO) for the AI for Accessibility project. Our objective is to create a non-profit ecosystem within the accessibility technology domain, catering to the needs and requirements of a wide range of stakeholders. This includes users with accessibility needs, caregivers, researchers, students, charities, etc.
Currently, we have open-sourced the [Tinkerable Augmentative and Alternative Communication System (TAAC System)](https://github.com/boyiny/Tinkerable-AAC-Keyboard), an AI-powered text entry system designed to facilitate communication for non-speaking individuals with motor disabilities. This system also provides researchers with the capability to easily expand upon it and conduct experiments. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:by266@cam.ac.uk).
